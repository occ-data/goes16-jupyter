This repo contains a notebook and sample mesoscale data (bands 1-3) from GOES-16. The notebook gives an example of how to read the netcdf files, convert from radiance to reflectance, and generate a psuedo-true color image.

This notebook is designed to work with the docker container available at (https://github.com/occ-data/docker-jupyter)[https://github.com/occ-data/docker-jupyter]
